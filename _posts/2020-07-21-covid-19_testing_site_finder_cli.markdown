It's 1:30am on a monday, and I've finally finished my very first project as a Flatiron Student, The CLI Data Gem Project. Working full time, and part time school was very changeling. There was many ups and down this year, but I’m glad I’m am still pushing forward, and bettering my self.


When building my project, I started to understand why we do each lab. They were basically part of a puzzle, but in CLI form. I can’t wait to start on a new project, and hopefully I do better this time.

My program allows a user to find a Coronavirus(COVID-19) testing site by entering their city or zip-code. Then it will list different locations. Once you find one, you can choose an location but typing an number to find out more information. Then it will provide informations of the name, address, and phone number. This project was fun, and changeling, but im happy i finish! I cant wait to work on bigger project, but hopefully I can finish early.
