When i was a kid, and when myspace was very popular. I always loved creating my own page, but never knew what i was doing, and what coding  was. THen year later, i found out you can make career in coding. I never had the time to do it, due to personal reason, but now im willing to leaarn. I also wanted to create or help build a websits, or even a APP.   I looking foward on learning a new life skill.
