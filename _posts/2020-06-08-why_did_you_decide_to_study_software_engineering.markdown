I decide to study software engineering beacuse i always wanted to create my own website, or build an app. I know coding is a great skill set, and you can alway learn something new. Back when i was a kid, i always edit my own myspace page, but I didnt know i was coding. Learning code, can open many doors for me. I want to build a career that i like doing, and see myself doing for years. This is why i want to study software engineering.
